# .ai-workspace

This directory contains AI-generated working files, test outputs, and session artifacts created during development iterations.

## Structure

- `session-YYYY-MM-DD/` - Timestamped development sessions
  - `summaries/` - Results summaries and feature documentation
  - `test-outputs/` - Test files and experimental outputs
  - `intermediate-results/` - Intermediate processing results (CSV, JSON summaries)

## Purpose

These files document the development process but are not part of the production codebase. They serve as historical context for understanding design decisions and evolution.

## Guidelines

- **Session directories** are timestamped to track development iterations
- **Summaries** capture major milestones, fixes, and feature implementations
- **Test outputs** contain experimental files created during development
- **Intermediate results** include processing artifacts and analysis outputs

## Retention

Files in this directory are preserved to maintain development history and can be referenced when understanding design evolution. They are not required for production use.
